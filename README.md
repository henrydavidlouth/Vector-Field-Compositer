Vector Field Compositer - Averaging

Overview:
Particulate Aggregation Studies v1

Salt deposition via evaporation in super-saturated solution
technique. Aggregate growth over 3 months climbing over and
downward containing vessel.
Can we harness natural growth and formation behaviour
through subtle intervention?
Can the brackish salts and silts in the tidal Thames be made
architecturally relevant?

Salt seeding
The research speculates on the potential of salt accretion and
precipitation from solute as a relevant process of formation
for a brackish environment of the tidal Thames. The results
suggest that through subtle location of seeding material and
forecasting elapsed time of exposure, aggregations of crystals
or mineral deposition may occur upon seeding material.
Results of formation vary between initial seeding location
in full immersion, river bed itself, surface suspension, or
embankment face placements.
